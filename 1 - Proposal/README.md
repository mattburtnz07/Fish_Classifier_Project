# Fish-Classification
This repo holds the work I have done to build a machine learning project end to end for the Udacity machine Learning Engineer Capstone Project. The project involved creating a dataset of images, labelling the images, training a CNN classifier using Sagemake, exporting an ONNX model and building a web application to use the model.
